# List Cities

This is the first project I implemented with JavaScript.
My goal in creating this project is to learn more advanced topics for myself in JavaScript and learn how to work with Git.

# Features

-   Add new city: checks that the input is not empty or duplicate.
-   Delete city: before deleting, the user is asked a question, if he/she was sure, this city will be deleted.
-   Edit city: as a prompt, it receives a new value from the user, alerts the user if it is duplicate, and updates it if it is a new input value.
-   Display in Google Maps: clicking on this button, the current city name will be displayed in Google maps
-   Clear items: clicking this button will remove all cities from your list.
-   Alert Box: We used the sweetalert2 library to display alerts.

# For Learning

I think this project is very useful for those who are currently learning JavaScript. Because they can implement a practical project with the knowledge they have of JavaScript.
I understand the topics better by doing my own project.
